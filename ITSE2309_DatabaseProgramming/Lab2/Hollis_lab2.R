# Create a vector named Ones that contains the numbers from 1 to 5.
# In this script create a vector named Twos that contains the numbers from 
# 2 to 10 counting by 2 like this: Twos <- c(seq(from = 2, to = 10, by = 2))
# Create three more vectors, named Threes, Fours, and Fives. 
# Vector Threes should count by threes and include 5 values. 
# Vector Fours should count by fours and contain five numbers. 
# Vector Fives should count by fives and contain five numbers.

# Make sure you have a name for the new column that follows the naming 
# convention in step 6.

# times_table data frame.

#   1. One command that looks for row 2 using the data frame index.

#    2. One command that looks for rows 2, 3, and  4 using the data frame index.

#    3. One command that looks for Initials_Threes by itâ€™s column name.
