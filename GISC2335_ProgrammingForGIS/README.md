# **GISC2335: Programming for GIS**

Welcome to the repository for **GISC2335: Programming for GIS**, a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) course at Dallas College. This repository contains my completed chapter assignments, portfolio projects, notes, and exercises from the Spring 2025 semester.

> **Note:** As of **April 2025**, this repository is a **work in progress** as I continue organizing my files and adding project documentation. Updates will be made regularly.

---

## **Course Overview**

**GISC2335** is a capstone course designed to strengthen GIS programming skills through hands-on exercises and custom GIS tool development. Emphasizing Python scripting for ArcGIS Pro, students explore geoprocessing workflows, data manipulation, and desktop-to-web publishing scenarios.

Projects involve customizing ESRI’s ArcGIS software, automating geoprocessing tasks, manipulating spatial and raster data, and building reusable GIS tools. The course also includes independent portfolio development and a final exam.
