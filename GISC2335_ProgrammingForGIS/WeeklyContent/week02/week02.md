## **Week 2: PB&J Exercise**
 
### **Assignment Description**

This introductory assignment is designed to help you understand the importance of precise logic in programming. I wrote a step-by-step “program” that explains how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich—as if giving instructions to a computer.

💡 **Key Concepts Covered:**
- Practice translating a real-world task into detailed, executable steps.
- Learn how ambiguity in instructions can cause errors in programming.
- Begin thinking like a computer: literal, procedural, and detail-oriented.
