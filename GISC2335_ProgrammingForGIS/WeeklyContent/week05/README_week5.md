## **Week 5: Chapter 4 â€“ Learning Python Language Fundamentals**

### **Assignment Description**

This weekâ€™s lab corresponds to **Chapter 4: Learning Python Language Fundamentals** and introduces the core building blocks of Python scripting. It is a conceptual and hands-on introduction to variables, data types, functions, and control structures essential for writing effective GIS scripts.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Concepts Covered:**
- Numeric operations and expressions
- String manipulation and indexing
- Variables and data storage
- Lists, slicing, and basic data structures
- Built-in functions and methods
- Modules (`math`, `random`) and how to import them
- Script creation using IDLE
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `break`)
- Commenting and documenting code
- Error checking and debugging using syntax checks and exception prompts

---

### **Deliverables**

- A collection of small scripts (`path.py`, `branching.py`, `while_loop.py`, `for_loop.py`, `break_loop.py`)
- Demonstrations of:
  - Proper use of functions and control structures
  - Script organization with comments and error handling
  - Working with lists and strings effectively
- Each script should be saved within a clearly named folder (e.g., `Ex04/`) and tested for accuracy
