### **Assignment Description**

This lab focuses on Chapter 3: **Geoprocessing in ArcGIS Pro**, and builds foundational skills in using ArcPy to automate spatial workflows. Students explore tool execution, workspace management, ModelBuilder, and scripting with Python.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Concepts Covered:**
- Setting environment workspaces and default geodatabases
- Running geoprocessing tools like `Clip_analysis` through the GUI, ModelBuilder, Python window, and script editor
- Using batch processing for repetitive tasks
- Creating and executing models in ModelBuilder
- Writing and running stand-alone Python scripts using IDLE
- Exporting a model to Python code for deeper scripting insights

---

### **Deliverables**

- A complete ArcGIS Pro project with:
  - Batch clipped vector layers
  - A ModelBuilder model titled **Flooding Analysis**
  - Script output layers (`lakes_myClip`, `soils_Clip`, etc.)
- Standalone Python scripts (`my_clip.py`, `flooding.py`) stored in your exercise directory
- Evidence of correct execution (tool history, display layers, or screenshots if requested)
