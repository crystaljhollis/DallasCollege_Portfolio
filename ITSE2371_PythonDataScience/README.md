# ITSE2371: Python Data Science Tools

Welcome to the repository for **ITSE2371: Python Data Science Tools**, part of the Python Developer Certificate at Dallas College. This repository contains lab work, projects, and supplemental materials completed during the course.

---

## Course Overview

**ITSE2371** explores the libraries, tools, and techniques of Python as applied to the field of data science and machine learning. Through hands-on lab assignments, I developed the skills necessary to analyze data, build models, and apply machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.
