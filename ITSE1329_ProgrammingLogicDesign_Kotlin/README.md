# **ITSE1329: Programming Logic and Design (Kotlin)**

Welcome to the repository for **ITSE1329: Programming Logic and Design**, a required course in the **Python Developer Certificate** at Dallas College. This repository contains my completed assignments, coding exercises, and learning materials from the course.

> **Note:** As of **February 2025**, this repository is a **work in progress** as I migrate and organize my files for better structure and accessibility. Updates will be made regularly.

## **Course Overview**

**ITSE1329** focuses on the fundamentals of problem-solving through structured programming techniques. The course covers algorithm development, control structures, data types, and software design principles. Although the certificate emphasizes Python, this course introduced me to **Kotlin**, along with visual programming tools like **Karel the Robot** and **Flowgorithm** to strengthen logical thinking and programming fundamentals.

Through hands-on coding exercises, I applied programming logic to real-world problems, explored control structures, and developed algorithms to improve computational thinking.
