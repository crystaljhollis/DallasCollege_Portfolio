# ENGR2300: Applied Linear Algebra
Welcome to the repository for **ENGR 2300: Applied Linear Algebra**, an engineering and mathematics course at Dallas College. This repository contains lesson notes, code and handwritten examples, projects, and supplemental materials completed during the course.
> **Note:** As of **February 2025**, this repository is a **work in progress** as I am in the process of taking the course. Updates will be made regularly.

## What is Linear Algebra?

**Linear Algebra** is a branch of mathematics that focuses on solving systems of linear equations, understanding vector spaces, and working with matrices and transformations. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including engineering, physics, economics, and computer science.  

This course covers:  
✅ **Solving Systems of Equations** – Methods to find unknowns in multiple equations.  
✅ **Matrices & Determinants** – Tools for organizing and computing solutions efficiently.  
✅ **Vector Spaces & Transformations** – Theoretical foundations for geometric and functional applications.  
✅ **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors** – Key concepts for applications like population models, electrical networks, and computer graphics.  

With a balance of **theory and computation**, linear algebra is essential for students in mathematics, science, and engineering.

## Course Overview
**ENGR2300** explores the fundamental concepts of linear algebra and their applications in engineering. Through hands-on assignments in MATLAB and Jupyter Notebook, I developed skills in solving systems of linear equations, performing matrix operations, and applying techniques such as Gaussian elimination, eigenvalue analysis, and vector space transformations to real-world engineering problems.
