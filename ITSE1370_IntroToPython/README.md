# **ITSE1370: Introduction to Python Programming**

Welcome to the repository for **ITSE1370: Introduction to Python Programming**, part of the Python Developer Certificate at Dallas College. This repository contains my completed scripts, notes, and exercises from the course.

> **Note:** As of **February 2025**, this repository is a **work in progress** as I migrate and organize my files for better structure and accessibility. Updates will be made regularly to ensure content is complete and well-organized.

## **Course Overview**

**ITSE1370** introduces the fundamentals of Python programming with an emphasis on structured design, data types, decision logic, and basic problem-solving techniques. The course covers both **procedural** and **object-oriented programming** concepts, helping build a strong foundation for further studies in programming and software development.

Through hands-on lessons, labs, and a final project, I developed key programming skills such as working with variables, control flow, functions, data structures, and object-oriented design principles.

## **Dependencies**

This course focuses on core Python concepts and uses the standard Python library. No external libraries are required unless specified in individual lessons or labs.

- Python 3.x (recommended: latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

---

## **Final Project**

The final project for this course incorporates concepts from all chapters, requiring the application of **problem-solving skills**, **logical thinking**, and **object-oriented programming** to build a functional Python application. You can find the project files within the corresponding chapter or script folder.
